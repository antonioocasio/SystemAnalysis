# SystemAnalysis

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass was a program that was used to create an online driving school to better drivers on the road. The client was DriverPass, who wanted me to design a program that was able to run on a web-based program as well as phones and tablets. 

What did you do particularly well?
For this project I think that I did the business requirements documents well. Being able to pull the purpose of the program, requirements for the operating systems, etc. was a huge part in creating programs. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
The part that I would revise would be possibly the functional and nonfunctional requirements. I struggle somewhat to decide what requirements are what but I still think that I did a good job. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Interpreting user's needs for system design was determined by looking at the layout that DriverPass provided. This gave me an idea on how they want the UI to look and I was able to make adjustments for the user to make sure that it is friendly and easy to use. It's important to consider the user's when desiging because if there is a mistake or it's hard to find a certain area in the program, the user could get irritated and switch to a different company. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
The way that I approach designing software is by writing down requirements and pseudocode. The reason I do this is so I can see exactly what I need and how I plan on doing it. The strategies that I plan on using in the future is the business design requirements document that I used for DriverPass. All programs that I create could be helped by writing down the requirements in this document.
